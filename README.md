# webserver-rust

Right now, this project is just following along with the rust book web server project,
but I plan to branch off from it soon. In fact, I don't even plan on following the multithreading guide.

## Compiling

Make sure to compile using x86_64-unknown-linux-musl as the target, so it will run on most servers
